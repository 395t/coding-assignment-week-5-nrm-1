# Instance Normalization Empirical Analysis

We analyze the performance of instance normalization with the same backbone network on three datasets: CIFAR-100, STL10, TinyImagenet.

Per our evaluation protocol, we run all the experiments on several learning rates ranging from 0.001 to 0.03 and we show their respective training curves(loss vs. epoch) and their best-performing test accuracy.

The metric used for test is top-1 accuracy.
